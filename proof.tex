\section{Formal Guarantee}
\subsection{Correctness}
\subsubsection{Tock Tree Setup}
In order to reason about the CEKR machine, we needed to reason about nodes in the tock tree, even if such node is evicted.

While we can reify the tock tree insertions into a list, forming into a trace semantic and reasoning on top of the list, it is easier to allow querying the tock tree for evicted data. In our formalization, we assume that the tock tree does not really evict; However, each node is now paired with a boolean bit, indicating whether it had been evicted or not. We will then have a function query\_ghost : (TockTree, Tock) -> (Bool, Node) that return the Node, along with a boolean indicating whether the node is present.

With query\_ghost, we can compare values between CEK and CEKR. More specifically, a value X under Heap H in CEK is equal to a value Y under Tock T in CEKR, if the cell pointed to by X (via lookup) and pointed to by Y (via query\_ghost) is equal. This is a recursive definition as cells might contain more values.

Like wise, we can define equality on continuation, and on state. Additionally, we define 'equality modulo eviction' between two Tock Tree, to be that the two Tock Tree contain the same node, but they might be under different eviction status. Formally speaking, forall Tock, the two Tock Tree must return two equal node, but the eviction bit might differ.

Alongside query\_ghost, is the idea of ghost\_stepping \todo{this name suck}. Just like the state transition on CEKR, ghost\_stepping is also a transition on State, TockTree tuple. However, unlike the classical state transition, ghost\_stepping use query\_ghost in place of query, which retrieve the exact node, even if the node is evicted. ghost\_stepping is unimplementable, but just like our formalization of Tock Tree and query\_ghost, it is purely for formalization purpose. As ghost\_step does not need any replay, it does not have the replay continuation. ghost\_step serve as a bridge between CEK and CEKR, connecting the two semantic. Once this is completed, we can only talk about correspondence between ghost\_step and normal step, inside CEKR, without mentioning the CEK machine at all.

Lemma: CEK stepping is deterministic.
proof: trivial.

Lemma: Ghost stepping is deterministic.
proof: trivial. note that this require the tock tree being deterministic itself. write down this requirement in the right place.

\subsubsection{Well Foundness}
A tock tree T is well-founded \todo{is this the right word?} if:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The left most node exist and is not be evicted. (root-keeping)
	\item Forall node N inserted at tock T, N only refer to tock < T. (tock-ordering)
	\item Forall node pair L R (R come right after L in the tock tree), if (L.state, T) ghost\_step to (X, XT), X = R.state and T eqmodev XT. (replay-correct)
	\item Additionally, a (state, tock tree) pair is well-founded if the right most node exist, and equal to state. (laststate-correct)
\end{enumerate}

Lemma: ghost stepping preserve well-foundedness.
proof:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item root-keeping is maintained by the tock tree implementation and is a requirement.
	\item tock-ordering is maintained - check each insert.
	\item replay-correct is maintained: there are two cases here. if the pair already exist, then adding a new rightmost node (it must be rightmost due to laststate-correct) is irrelevant. otherwise it is the last pair, and we just did the corresponding ghost-step. It is maintain because ghost-stepping is deterministic.
	\item laststate-correct is maintained: check each ghoststep case, and they should all insert the last state.
\end{enumerate}

Lemma: under well-foundness, CEK-step and ghost-stepping preserve equivalence.
Formally: given CEK-step X, CEKR state Y, if (X, H) = (Y, T) and T is well-founded, (X, H) $\leadsto$ (X', H'), (Y, T) $\leadsto$ (Y', T'), (X', H') = (Y', T')
proof: wellfoundness ensure we do not write to old state and replace old node with other values. other part of proof is trivial.

Evaluating under replay semantic give same result as under normal semantic

Evaluating will eventually produce a value

Decreasing on lexicalgraphic ordering on the replay stack do work

\subsection{Performance}
memory consumption is linear to amount of object with O(1) access cost

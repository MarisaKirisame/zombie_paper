	\begin{abstract}
		Program execution need memory. Program may run out of memory for multiple reasons: big dataset, exploding intermediate state, the machine have less memory than others, etc. When this happens, the program either get killed, or the operating system swaps, significantly degrading the performance.
		We propose a technique, uncomputation, that allow the program to continue running gracefully even after breaching the memory limit, without significant performance degradation.
		Uncomputation work by turning computed values back into thunk, and upon re-requesting the thunk, computing and storing them back.
		A naive implementation of uncomputation will face multiple problems. Among them, the most crucial and the most challenging one is that of breadcrumb. After a value is uncomputed, it's memory can be released but some memory, breadcrumb, is needed, so we can recompute the value back.
		Ironically, in a applicative language, due to boxing all values are small. This mean uncomputation, implemented naively, will only consume more memory, defeating the purpose.
		We present a runtime system, implemented as a library, that is absolved of the above breadcrumb problem.

	\section{Implementation}
	\subsection{Tock Tree}
	To exploit the temporal/spatial locality, and the 20-80 law of data access (cite?), the tock tree is implemented as a slight modification of a splay tree.

	This design grant frequently-accessed data faster access time. Crucially, consecutive insertion take amortized constant time.
	
	The tock tree is then modified such that each node contain an additional parent and child pointer. The pointers form a list, which maintain an sorted representation of the tock tree. On a query, the tock tree do a binary search to find the innermost node, then follow the parent pointer if that node is greater then the key. This process is not recursive: the parent pointer is guaranteed to have a smaller node then the input key, as binary search will yield either the exact value, or the largest value less then the input, or the smallest value greater then the input.
	\subsection{Picking Uncomputation Candidate}
	Note that the guarantee we prove is independent of our policy that decide which value to uncompute (eviction policy).
	\subsubsection{Union Find}
	\subsubsection{The Policy}
	\subsubsection{GDSF}
	\subsection{Language Implementation}
	For implementation simplicity and interoperability with other programs, zombie is implemented as a C++ library, and the Cells are ref-counted. Our evaluation compiles the program from the applicative programming language formalized above(give name), to C++ code.
	\subsection{Optimization}
	\subsubsection{Fast access path}
	Querying the tock tree for every value is slow, as it requires multiple pointer traversal.
	To combat this, each Value is a Tock paired with a weak reference, serving as a cache, to the Cell. When reading the value, if the weak reference is ok, the value is return immediately. Otherwise the default path is executed, and the weak reference is updated to point to the new Result.
	\subsubsection{Loop Unrolling}
	To avoid frequent creation of node object, and their insertion to the tock tree, multiple state transition is packed into one.
	\subsection{Bit counting}

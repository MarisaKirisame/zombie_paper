\begin{abstract}
  Programs need memory to execute,
    and when there isn't enough memory available,
    programs can swap, crash, or even get killed by the operating system.
  To fix this, we propose \name,
    a purely-function programming language implementation
    that allows programs to continue running
    (albeit much slower)
    while using much less memory than necessary
    to store all of the program's heap-accessible values.
  \name works by replacing pointers with abstract ``tocks'',
    each of which refers to a value via the point in time
    when it was allocated.
  This allows \name to evict computed values from memory
    and recompute them as necessary
    by rewinding and replaying program execution.
  \name's runtime stores a limited amount of metadata,
    much smaller than the total number of program steps,
    allowing it to shrink live memory dramatically.
  Thanks to a combination of optimizations
    and a powerful cache heuristic,
    \name is able to achieve memory reductions
    of up to \todo{XXX$\times$}
    while incurring slowdowns of \todo{XXX$\times$}.

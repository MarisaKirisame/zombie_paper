\begin{abstract}
	Program execution need memory. Program may run out of memory for multiple reasons: big dataset, exploding intermediate state, the machine have less memory than others, etc. When this happens, the program either get killed, or the operating system swaps, significantly degrading the performance.
	We propose a technique, uncomputation, that allow the program to continue running gracefully even after breaching the memory limit, without significant performance degradation.
	Uncomputation work by turning computed values back into thunk, and upon re-requesting the thunk, computing and storing them back.
	A naive implementation of uncomputation will face multiple problems. Among them, the most crucial and the most challenging one is that of breadcrumb. After a value is uncomputed, it's memory can be released but some memory, breadcrumb, is needed, so we can recompute the value back.
	Ironically, in a applicative language, due to boxing all values are small. This mean uncomputation, implemented naively, will only consume more memory, defeating the purpose.
	We present a runtime system, implemented as a library, that is absolved of the above breadcrumb problem.

\section{Call Stack}
While the above construction can 
\subsection{Tail Call}
Call stack - get a node with inf right value onto tock tree, fix when 'actual' return

Clock stack - put the value on the node

C++ stack - trampoline

Replay stack - bounded by the tock tree size * intermediate node count, so it is linear w.r.t. tock tree.
\subsection{Non Tail Call}
By doing a continuation passing style transform all call become tail call.
The continuation might grow in size but we can zombified it.
